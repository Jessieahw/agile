## Algorithm

- User can upload their own casual or semi pro data set (think local or college level team data: W/L + draw ratios, team counts, etc).
- The algorithm will match by ratio to closest matching team by these ratios in that sport and area (say the English Premier League for casual soccer in that area).
- This is based on an observation that people range from casual to competitive interest, and data of their own local play will reflect that in W/L or other quanitifiable metrics.
- This makes it useful to recommend certain teams to them in a quantifiable way.
- This can be specified down further from team to even player stats, in different roles for that team.

## User input example
The user will enter their own data from the same sport into columns that match the stats to that of the league stats we have compiled.
This will be most suited to a table format.
